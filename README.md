Da bestest game evar.

EDIT: I (Hunter) got multiple inputs to work and I made a new class Keyer to hold all listeners 
to get multi inputs to work i had to add action listeners and swing timers - they're really easy to learn you can look them up if you want
If you guys want to contribute go ahead but I will complete this by myself for fun if you don't
